# Database initilization

By defualt the database is already created and empty in the file `Prod.db`. Nevertheless, if a new clean copy is desired, you can always run the following commands.

* **Windows** double-click on `create_database.bat` or run the following command in this folder 

```
sqlite3 Prod.db < main.sql
```

* **Linux**  run the above command also in this folder, but `sqlite3` should be installed before.
