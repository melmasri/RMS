Things left to do in the UIS project
    * Waiting for an email from Patrick on Diss Index.
    * Calculate attrition rate.
    * Add attrition rate and Diss Index to documentation.
    * Document Audit trail method for Meter and Indic.
    * Edit all the python comment for creating the help files, and create the help file.
    * Edit the user User guid, indicator calculation and add new indicator files, and probably combined them.
    * Update the github website with all the new documentation.
    * Try to create a nice PDF file or plain text for them to print from all the documentation, since org-mode export default export needs some tweeks.
    * We have created a file called 'user_guide-technical.org' earlier in the project, where can we integrate it, and what needs to be update it sine our last submission.
    * Add file naming for indicator extractions.
